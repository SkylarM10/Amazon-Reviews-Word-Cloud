I've used it on carpet and hard floors, in several locations throughout the house. Once you get the hang of pulling the sections apart and leveling the pole, it takes about 5-10 minutes to set up - and most of that time is for leveling.Regarding the quality of the pole itself - it's excellent. It's hefty and simply looks and feels high quality. I feel totally confident in my shoulder mounts, inversions, etc on this pole. I also have a nickel allergy, so I appreciate that Lupit makes a hypoallergenic chrome pole.The finish is grippy right out of the box (once it wiped down of course) and warms up fast, unlike some of the poles at my local studio which never seem to warm up for whatever reason. It has the perfect amount of whip to it but is rock-solid stable as long as you take the time to make sure it's level it during install. I reccomend to use a spirit level for this, NOT to eyeball it.This pole is unlocked to spin with an Allen wrench, which I actually prefer to poles that unlock by pulling on a collar from the floor - because it prevents you from putting the pole on spin while doing headstands or floor moves that have you grabbing near the base of the pole. The spin on the pole is smooth and not too loose but it gets nice and fast with momentum.The top cup has left no marks or damage on the ceiling. Very important, right? :)Other details I like: the smooth transition of the mask to the bottom of the pole, it's a really nice detail that you don't see on cheaper no-name poles and might be something to consider if you're grabbing down there frequently. I've danced on cheaper poles and unintentionally unscrewed the mask while dancing - and I can tell that's just not possible with this pole.Overall no complaints at all. Arrived quickly and in good condition and is a pleasure to dance on.\"}\n",
