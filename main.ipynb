Popcorn ceilings and X-Pole's atrocious wait times can't even stand in your way now\", 'body': \"Where to start?I've been wanting a home pole for ages, and have had my eye on an X-Pole for years.  Now that it was time to finally pull the trigger, and I jumped into my research.  While XP is still easily the most popular, I was picking up on a LOT of recent customer service issues online (customers having their card info stolen, double charges, endless processing times), all without being able to easily reach a customer support agent.  Lots of these people stated that they wished they had gone with Lupit pole.Lupit really checked out and everything I read about the quality and process seemed really great-- and then I noticed they even had an Amazon store.  I placed my order on a Monday evening, and the pole of my dreams arrived that Friday!  The shipping was a little expensive, but it's a big and HEAVY box, so I get it.  They also delivered it to my upstairs apartment door; what a pleasant surprise!  Assembly was a breeze using one of their YouTube videos-- and this is with popcorn ceilings.  I absolutely LOVE this pole.\"}\n",
      "{'title': 'Great pole, bought an extension', 'body': 'Pole is wonderful, easy to put together. Iâ€™m a beginner, 100% recommend it but I will say the only down side to this purchase was DHL could not find my address.  Never had that problem before but I ended up having to pick up the pole an hour from my home since they said they needed additional information but there was no additional information to give.I told Customer Service about the inconvenience to pay $100+ for shipping and the item didnâ€™t come to my front door but oh well.The wildest part is I even got stopped by the police on the way (first time getting stopped for anythingggg)! So maybe if I would not have had to go pick it up that would not have happened. ðŸ˜‚Now the pole extension (purchased separately) was needed but you pay shipping per item which is odd since the extension was in the same box as the pole.. so in my opinion from my experience since I had to pick it up and hour away, overpriced shipping. Customer service was ok.'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Easy to install', 'body': 'I had an issue with the delivery, but the seller was super helpful in the resolution. I really appreciated the communication regarding my issues and everything worked out perfectly.Now the pole was easy to assemble, however, I recommend using a stud finder and a friend. Once we were able to locate the studs to ensure sturdiness it was a breeze. I recommend this for any beginner. The pole it self is a great thickness for grip and very sturdy. It does have some weight to it, so thatâ€™s why I recommend a friend to help for the installation especially if itâ€™s your first time. I am content.'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Love mine', 'body': 'Arrived quickly and easy to install. I love it!'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Very disappointing', 'body': 'This was a major disappointing purchase.  My pole arrived almost 2 weeks late. The box came with zero instructions and had no trenches or extension rings.  It was supposed fit my 9 foot ceilings, and it does not.  I wouldnâ€™t recommend wasting your money being that this is a very expensive pole that is useless.'}\n",

      "{'title': 'Easy to install', 'body': 'I have had this pole for all of one day and it was easy to install and feels very sturdy. Delivery was so much faster than I expected; less than a week.'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Perfect as Expected!', 'body': \"I was sad that the Lupit website seemed sold out of 45mm chrome poles in this style, but I'm glad I checked amazon, where the price+shipping is the same, but there was more availability! it's great so far, very easy to set up by myself.\"}\n",

It seems sturdy and well built. I canâ€™t speak to any other quality until itâ€™s up.@ Lupit Pole Seller, if youâ€™re reading this, please kindly ship me part B of the pole! Thank you!!!!'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Is not stable', 'body': 'Make sure you really want the pole other wise it cost 2 much to mail it back from the USA or Puerto Rico'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Great pole, excellent finish', 'body': \"I have been dancing on this pole almost daily since it arrived, installing and uninstalling it each time. I've used it on carpet and hard floors, in several locations throughout the house. Once you get the hang of pulling the sections apart and leveling the pole, it takes about 5-10 minutes to set up - and most of that time is for leveling.Regarding the quality of the pole itself - it's excellent. It's hefty and simply looks and feels high quality. I feel totally confident in my shoulder mounts, inversions, etc on this pole. I also have a nickel allergy, so I appreciate that Lupit makes a hypoallergenic chrome pole.The finish is grippy right out of the box (once it wiped down of course) and warms up fast, unlike some of the poles at my local studio which never seem to warm up for whatever reason. It has the perfect amount of whip to it but is rock-solid stable as long as you take the time to make sure it's level it during install. I reccomend to use a spirit level for this, NOT to eyeball it.This pole is unlocked to spin with an Allen wrench, which I actually prefer to poles that unlock by pulling on a collar from the floor - because it prevents you from putting the pole on spin while doing headstands or floor moves that have you grabbing near the base of the pole. The spin on the pole is smooth and not too loose but it gets nice and fast with momentum.The top cup has left no marks or damage on the ceiling. Very important, right? :)Other details I like: the smooth transition of the mask to the bottom of the pole, it's a really nice detail that you don't see on cheaper no-name poles and might be something to consider if you're grabbing down there frequently. I've danced on cheaper poles and unintentionally unscrewed the mask while dancing - and I can tell that's just not possible with this pole.Overall no complaints at all. Arrived quickly and in good condition and is a pleasure to dance on.\"}\n",
      "{'title': 'Easy and no tools necessary!', 'body': \"I've had 3 poles now and this one, hands down,  is my favorite.  It took 10 minutes to set up,  no ceiling or floor damage, no drilling AND it arrived a little early. I was an exotic dancer for 10 years and worked all over the country- this pole is as sturdy  if not more so than poles in some clubs out there.  I do a lot of tricks and spins and it never feels unsafe. I've had others try it and it even supported 2 people totaling a little under 300 lbs. I'm very happy with it.\"}\n",
      "{'title': 'Helpful review', 'body': 'Hi! Iâ€™ve danced for 2 years. This pole is very sturdy and very well put together. I wouldnâ€™t suggest for first time user because it is higher and thick pole. It spins faster than normal poles. But if your wanting to invest your money this is the pole. I have enjoyed it and love the attachment for vaulted ceilings.'}\n",
